# SHR Synth documentation

Source code, `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, preset parsers, and
`presets/cleared-presets.txt` define current behavior. This index separates
those contracts from research records, proposals, and dated session evidence.

## Current contracts

- [Open303 integration](OPEN303_INTEGRATION.md) describes the eighth model,
  native controls, four starts, and SHR behavior.

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) covers engine, model, callback, and offline
  tool boundaries.
- [Live host contract](HOST_CONTRACT.md) defines process arguments, ALSA/JACK
  ports, event timing, overflow behavior, shutdown, and failure ownership.
- [Preset and control schema](PRESET_SCHEMA.md) defines schema 10, model
  identities, exact fields, MIDI CCs, physical positions, and migrations.
- [Portability and deployment](PORTABILITY.md) records toolchain, dependency,
  platform, and evidence limits.
- [Bass Matrix](BASS_MATRIX.md) records the current model design and automated
  evidence.
- [Dependencies, licensing, and public presets](../THIRD_PARTY.md) owns the
  public 28-preset boundary and dependency review.

SHR-DAW starts SHR Synth as an external managed process. SHR Synth owns synthesis,
preset validation, ALSA input, and stereo JACK output. SHR-DAW owns its exact
dependency pin, configuration, process lifecycle, routes, replacement recovery,
Project state, and private preset storage.

## Research and dated evidence

- [Offline audio fitter](../tools/audio_fit/README.md) compares WAV excerpts
  and searches bounded source parameters through the existing offline renderer
  or an isolated prototype. Numerical recovery tests do not establish listening
  acceptance or the identity of the Temple 1992 studio sounds.

- [Isolated Open303 candidate](OPEN303_CANDIDATE.md) documents the optional
  repaired C++/Rust engine, offline audition command, provenance, and checks.
  It has no production model or live-host integration.

- [Open303 engine analysis](OPEN303_ANALYSIS.md) traces a pinned C++ core,
  confirms integration defects and offline reuse feasibility, and specifies
  a candidate boundary. It does not add or approve a production model.

- [Open-source analog modeling knowledge base](OPEN_SOURCE_ANALOG_MODELING.md)
  maps prior synth implementations, authors, licenses, and study priorities.
  Start here before proposing a new analog topology.

- [Research](RESEARCH.md) is the long-form source, experiment, rejection, and
  measurement record.
- [Bass impact research](BASS_IMPACT_RESEARCH.md) records the research basis
  and limits behind Bass Matrix.
- [Acid-chain synthesis research](ACID_CHAIN_RESEARCH.md) records the
  TD-3-SB functional study, clean-room boundary, and original Pressure Chain
  listening proposal. It is not a hardware model or live-engine contract.
- [Composite machine research](COMPOSITE_MACHINE_RESEARCH.md) preserves
  offline experiments and listening gates. It is not a live-engine contract.
- [Workspace handoff](HANDOFF.md) is a machine/session ledger. It includes
  historical states; source and the current contract documents above win when
  a dated entry conflicts with them.

## Proposed or incomplete work

- [Experimental direction](FUTURE_DIRECTION.md) describes unscheduled product
  and authoring ideas.
- [Micro-machine routing](MICRO_MACHINE_ROUTING.md) distinguishes the
  implemented Swarm Machine slice from deferred graph editing and general
  runtime proposals.

Files below `docs/superpowers/` are historical implementation plans. They are
useful provenance, but they do not define current behavior.
