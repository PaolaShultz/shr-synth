# Experimental direction

Status: open direction with one deliberately narrow typed-graph model now live;
not a promise of arbitrary user graphs or production acceptance.

SHR Synth should grow from a small catalog of authored synthesis models into an
open experimental instrument laboratory. A musician should be able to play the
built-in models, inspect how they work, alter them, and eventually create a new
instrument with or without AI assistance.

“Open” means more than publishing source. It means providing a comprehensible
path from a sound idea to a playable model while SHR Synth continues to own the
difficult host, voice, timing, preset, and real-time safety boundaries. The
inside of a model may be strange; its boundary should remain predictable.

The most promising authoring surface is a low-code, typed micro-machine graph.
Small oscillators, counters, events, shapers, followers, resonators, filters,
delays, feedback elements, and stereo operations could be connected in a
strict text description. SHR Synth would validate types, cycles, resource
limits, deterministic state, and real-time suitability before rendering. This
is intended as a machine-native laboratory, not another unrestricted modular-
synth clone.

Every playable model should continue to expose seven meaningful timbre controls,
shared instrument volume at physical position 5, and ADSR. The internal graph
can be complex, but the instrument must remain approachable through the same
SHR-DAW control surface.
Factory models, community models, and unfinished experiments should remain
clearly distinguishable.

AI may help draft graphs, model code, control mappings, explanations, and test
ideas. AI authorship is not evidence of safety or musical value. Human- and
AI-authored models should pass the same deterministic, finite-output,
allocation, resource, alias/error, stereo, chord, cleanup, and native-target
checks. Human listening remains the decision about whether an experiment is
worth keeping.

A familiar swarm or supersaw-like sound is the first live learning model for
this architecture. Its seven transparent node types make
oscillator population, detuning, phase/gear movement, stereo spread,
normalization, spectral shaping, bounded drive, and output guarding inspectable
while leaving production effects to SHR-DAW. The experiment asks whether a
small graph can produce a recognisable target with SHR Synth character. The
previously preferred warm-pad setting is the one factory start. Automated
bounds do not approve the sound or the broader architecture; human listening
in the live SHR path remains the gate.

The detailed technical possibilities and safety boundaries remain in
[Typed Micro-Machine Routing](MICRO_MACHINE_ROUTING.md). The implemented
schema-1 swarm scope and its production boundary are recorded there.
