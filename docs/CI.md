# Continuous integration

[The workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on pushes to `main`, pull
requests and manual dispatch. It uses read-only repository permissions, cancels
superseded runs and selects exact Rust 1.97.1 with locked Cargo dependencies.

All-feature (including native Open303 C++ regressions) and no-default-feature normal Rust suites run separately. The offline fitter Python contracts use the existing pinned requirements in an isolated hosted environment; the historical self_check search and audition renderers remain excluded.

The workflow contains the exact reproducible commands. Historical/exhaustive
auditions and benchmarks remain opt-in. No physical audio, MIDI, DMX, playback,
service activation, media download or deployment is part of these checks.
Compilation and synthetic tests do not establish Raspberry Pi hardware acceptance.
Clippy with warnings denied and release builds are not added as new CI gates.
