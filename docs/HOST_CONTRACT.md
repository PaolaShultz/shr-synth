# Live Host Contract

The live host is implemented by the `shr-synth` binary:

```sh
shr-synth --client-name shs-shr-synth --preset /path/to/file.mojsint
```

The existing `validate` and `render` subcommands remain available.

## Process and ports

Before joining audio, the process reads one regular preset file no larger than
1 MiB and strictly validates its versioned schema. It opens JACK with
`JACK_NO_START_SERVER`, uses the configured client name, and registers exactly
two audio outputs with stable short names `out_l` and `out_r`. It never starts,
restarts, reconfigures, or auto-connects JACK.

The same configured name is used for one discoverable ALSA Sequencer client
with one subscribable MIDI input port named `input`. Setup failures are printed
outside the callback and return non-zero. SIGINT, SIGTERM, ALSA failure, JACK
shutdown, or a callback fault cause bounded shutdown: the MIDI thread exits,
the JACK client deactivates, and owned resources close.

## MIDI and timing

The ALSA thread translates:

- Note On, including velocity-zero Note On as Note Off;
- Note Off;
- CC 20–34 as the 15-position superset (Pressure Chain and older models use CC 20–31);
- CC 7 as independently smoothed instrument volume;
- 14-bit Pitch Bend as ±2 semitones, centered at zero;
- CC 1 as vibrato depth, from none to ±50 cents at 5 Hz;
- CC 121 as a smoothed return of bend and vibrato to neutral;
- CC 35 as the press-only Dual Filter core toggle and CC 36 as exact core state;
- CC 120, CC 123, and Sequencer Reset as immediate All Notes Off.

All eight models apply wheels to already-held and subsequent notes without
retriggering envelopes or rewriting preset macros. They are transient,
instrument-wide controls in this single-instrument, omni-input host; this is
not per-channel MPE. New engines start centered with vibrato off. CC 120/123
silence notes but retain the wheel position. Wheel targets use 10 ms smoothing;
pitch updates reach model oscillators every 32 samples, preserving their phase,
mono glide, and held-note priority. Strange Oscillator retains its intentionally
quantized Register Machine source. No new surface slots or preset fields are used.
CC 1 follows the [MIDI controller assignment](https://midi.org/midi-1-0-control-change-messages).

It writes fixed-size events into a 1,024-slot SPSC queue. A full queue refuses
the new event without blocking and requests host shutdown: losing a release
makes continued note ownership unsafe. The normal shutdown closes only this
instrument's JACK client, silences it, and reports the MIDI queue overflow.
Reload the instrument after resolving the event flood. JACK and other clients
remain running. Queue faults and per-period deferral counts are reported only
by non-real-time threads.

The ALSA thread calls JACK's non-process-thread
`jack_frames_since_cycle_start` query, associates the resulting offset with the
next callback cycle, and queues that schedule. The callback clamps current
period offsets, applies late events at offset zero, retains one future event,
orders the bounded per-period batch by offset, and passes it to
`Engine::render_block`. After 256 events it retains the next event and stops
draining, preserving releases and the remaining FIFO backlog for later periods
instead of dropping them. Deferred events become late events at offset zero.

Polyphonic allocation uses an idle voice first, then the oldest released voice
(by note-on order), then the oldest held voice only when every voice is held.
Release tails cannot displace a held bass while a released voice is available.
The preset voice count is unchanged.

## Real-time boundary

The callback uses caller-owned JACK buffers, preallocated engine voices, a
fixed 256-event period array, and the lock-free queue. It performs no allocation
or free, locks, file I/O, logging, formatting, process work, waiting, or
per-sample trigonometric/exponential wheel setup. Wheel retuning is bounded
to one update per 32 samples; sine rotations and the native Open303 bend
factor are updated at that cadence only when changed. Model D cutoff and filter
coefficients are prepared before activation; macro smoothing and runtime
mappings use bounded scalar arithmetic.

The adapter choice is the small dynamic `libjack.so.0` FFI boundary already
used by SHR-DAW, plus `alsa` 0.7.1 for Sequencer input. This avoids a link-time
JACK development dependency while keeping unsafe JACK ownership in one module.
`libasound2-dev` is required to build the ALSA dependency.

SHR-DAW readiness requires the unambiguous configured or uniquely prefixed
client plus exactly the configured `out_l` and `out_r` ports. The host owns no
graph connections.

Pressure Chain requires schema 9 and one preallocated voice. Its bounded
128-key last-note priority retriggers contours on each press while preserving
overlap glide; returning to an older held note slides without retriggering.
It still publishes exactly one stereo output pair. There is no layered synth
process or per-topology output. All Notes Off clears its held-note stack as
well as DSP state.

Open303 requires schema 10, one voice, and a default-feature build. It uses the
same managed process and stereo return, with exact native filter identity kept
in the preset. CC7 is volume, CC20–23 and CC25–31 are its native controls;
CC24 is unused. See [the integration contract](OPEN303_INTEGRATION.md).
