# SHR Synth

SHR Synth is a headless experimental synthesizer and a distinct managed backend
for SHR-DAW. Its library keeps DSP independent of JACK, ALSA, files, processes,
and clocks; the binary provides strict preset validation, deterministic offline
rendering, and the live JACK/ALSA host.

The current experimental catalog contains eight synthesis models: circuit-
informed Model D, Six-Op PM, Strange Oscillator, the typed-graph Swarm Machine,
Bass Matrix, Dual Filter, monophonic Pressure Chain, and Open303. The first five models
retain twelve normalized engine controls; SHR exposes seven timbre values,
independent volume at position 5, and ADSR. Pressure Chain exposes eight timbre
values plus amp ADSR, with SWEEP at position 5. Dual Filter uses 15: two
cutoff/resonance/envelope-depth blocks, continuous `STRUCTURE`, filter ADSR,
and amp ADSR. Its separate synth rotary click crossfades between INDUSTRIAL
and COUNTER cores without retriggering a held note. The
[preset and control schema](docs/PRESET_SCHEMA.md) owns the exact mappings.
The 28 factory starts are playable research outcomes and starting points,
not a production-release claim.

## Usage

The default Open303 model requires a C++17 compiler. Its [native controls and
four presets](docs/OPEN303_INTEGRATION.md) preserve acid accent/slide behavior.

```sh
# Validate or render without JACK
cargo run -- validate presets/reference.mojsint
cargo run -- render presets/reference.mojsint output.wav --note 60 --seconds 1

# Live host: joins an existing JACK server but never starts or reconfigures it
cargo run -- --client-name shs-shr-synth --preset presets/reference.mojsint
```

The factory catalog contains seven Model D starts, six Six-Op PM starts, one
Strange Oscillator start, one Swarm Machine warm pad, one Bass Matrix
transformer, and five Dual Filter starts derived from the approved lead and
four bass directions, three Pressure Chain topologies, and four Open303 starts. These are editable
live starting points, not 28 claims
of separate synthesis families.

The live process publishes one ALSA Sequencer input named `input` and exactly
two JACK outputs named `out_l` and `out_r`. It does not connect them to physical
or other JACK ports.

## Local installation

```sh
cargo install --path . --locked
install -d "$HOME/.local/share/shr-synth/presets"
while IFS= read -r preset; do
  install -m644 "presets/$preset" "$HOME/.local/share/shr-synth/presets/"
done < presets/cleared-presets.txt
```

SHR-DAW's default configuration includes that user preset root. Presets added
there are user data; they are not copied back into either repository.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --all-targets --all-features
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build --release --all-targets
```

The [documentation index](docs/README.md) separates current contracts from
research evidence, historical plans, and future work. Start there for the
architecture, live-host contract, preset schema, portability notes, model
evidence, and experimental direction.

The cleared public installation boundary and dependency licence review are in
[THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md). Only the files named by
`presets/cleared-presets.txt` are factory-installable.

SHR-DAW owns its exact SHR Synth installation revision in
`install/compatibility.json`, along with process startup, routing, and recovery.
That pin can lag this repository's current schema and catalog; SHR Synth owns
the host and preset contracts, not SHR-DAW's update schedule.
